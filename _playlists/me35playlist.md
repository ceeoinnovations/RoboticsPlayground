# Learning Goals
The goal of Prof. Rogers’ Intro to Robotics course is to provide students with an introductory level of understanding in the field of robotics. Particular emphasis was placed on creatively inventing, coding, and making things to solve robotics challenges.

<div class="learninggoals" markdown="1">

The following placemats are intended to be progressed through in the sequence they are presented. Therefore, later projects may draw on knowledge acquired through earlier projects. If one placemat is selected individually, it may be useful to review the code and concepts explained on previous placemats. Although these placemats primarily focus on the SPIKE Prime Lego platform, they also feature the use of [WIO Terminals](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Getting-Started/) and [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).

: WIO Demo

description
: Before getting started with the Lego SPIKE Prime kits, the first assignment was intended to familiarize students with using the WIO Terminal. Completed individually, this project was assigned before the start of classes, giving students plenty of time to test out different aspects of the WIO.

: Video Game

description
: Drawing on the WIO skills developed in the previous project, this assignment combined the WIO and SPIKE Prime into one design. Focus was placed on using sensors from the kit and sending their data over serial to the WIO. Students were paired up to complete this project in one week.

description
: This project focused on the use of just the SPIKE Prime, and did not require the use of a WIO Terminal, but one could be included if desired. Students completed this assignment in pairs over one week. It resulted in an in-class competition to see which robots could make it across the room following lines of tape without running into other robots.

: The Letter C

description
: This project was assigned during a lesson that introduced students to both forward and inverse kinematics concepts. While there are many ways to approach the project, that knowledge proved useful in the design of many students’ systems. Links to some relevant information can be found on the placemat itself. This project was completed in pairs over one week, and included the optional use of the WIO Terminal.

: Smart Lego Dashboard

description
: In contrast to most of the other projects, this assignment required students to get creative with non-lego components. Since the goal was to create a physical dashboard structure that displayed some information, the use of cardboard, paper, markers, or even laser-cut wood was recommended. These outside components were combined with pieces from the Lego kits to create a hanging dashboard. Students completed this project in pairs over the course of one week, and had the option to work again with the WIO Terminal or begin using the Raspberry Pi.

: Flask Web Server

description
: While this was not a project specifically assigned in Prof. Rogers’ class, this placemat was created as a supplement to the following one, the Webcam Car. Since designing a Flask web site is a major component of that project, this placemat is intended to introduce students to the basics of a Flask web server.

: Webcam Car

description
: Since this was the first project requiring use of a Raspberry Pi, there was a learning curve for some students when combining the SPIKE Prime and Pi into one design. The previous placemat on creating a Flask web site is intended to supplement this project, so it is suggested that it be completed or at least reviewed before advancing to this project. In class, this assignment was completed in pairs over the course of a week, and resulted in an in-class race where the drivers stayed in the classroom and had to remotely navigate their car through the hallway outside the room.

: Smart Teleprompter

description
: Intended to be a midterm project that would test what each student has learned in the class so far, this project was completed individually over one week. It combines many concepts featured in previous placemats in this playlist, therefore it would be useful to first complete the projects leading up to this one, or reference relevant placemats when stumped by a particular part.

: Waltzing Robots

description
: As the final project of the class, this project was completed by teams of two or three students over a three week period. Toward the beginning of the process, the students, TAs, and professor had multiple brainstorming sessions to determine what requirements were reasonable and what the classroom setup would be on the day of the final waltz. It was decided that a circle of tape would be placed around the room to guide the robots in a larger circle, but various aspects and requirements of the project may be changed to fit with any individual classroom setup.
